# redflow
I wrote this to try and learn machine learning and AI and also Rust so don't expect a top level project.

## Current/planned functions and features:
### Currently done:
- [x] Sigmoid function
- [x] Sigmoid derivative
- [x] Weights and bias generation

### Being worked on
- [ ] Forward propagation
- [ ] Backward propagation

### Planned for next stage
- [ ] A CSV parser
- [ ] A way to generate graphs for the data

The first part of this library will basically be taken from this, then I hope to expand on it later with other methods and additional functions.

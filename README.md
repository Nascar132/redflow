# redflow
I wrote this to try and learn machine learning and AI and also Rust so don't expect a top level project.

## Current/planned functions and features:
### Extras:
- You can choose to what decimal point a function will round to. A higher number will obviously give a more precise value but a bigger file size if you store it.
### Currently done:
- [x] Sigmoid function
- [x] Sigmoid derivative
- [x] Weights and bias generation
- [x] Forward propagation

### Being worked on
- [ ] Backward propagation
- ### Optional
- [ ] Go back and test if the reset code can be removed between iteration statements

### Planned for next stage
- [ ] A CSV parser
- [ ] A way to generate graphs for the data

The first part of this library will basically be taken from this, then I hope to expand on it later with other methods and additional functions.
